# Harvest Tracker

A personal Flutter web app for logging time entries to [Harvest](https://www.getharvest.com/) directly from the browser, with first-class Azure DevOps integration.

## Features

### Log Time
- **Project & task selection** — loads your assigned projects and tasks from the Harvest API; responsive layout places the two dropdowns side-by-side on wide screens
- **Default project & task** — configure defaults in Settings so the form is pre-filled on load
- **Hours & minutes input** — pick hours (0–24) and minutes in 5-minute intervals
- **Date picker** — log time against any past date, defaulting to today

### Azure DevOps Integration
- **Configurable ADO instances** — add any number of Azure DevOps project URLs in Settings; select the active instance via a styled segmented button with PAT-status dots
- **PAT authentication** — store a Personal Access Token per instance (stored in `localStorage`, never committed); instances with a configured PAT show a green dot
- **Live work item preview** — type a work item number and see title + state fetched from ADO in real time (debounced 600 ms)
- **Work item chip** — ADO-linked entries display a compact inline card with a 3 px colour-coded state stripe, `#id · state · type`, and the creator's avatar (photo when available, initials fallback)
- **Auto-prefixed notes** — notes are automatically prefixed, e.g. `Transport Azure DevOps User Story #13483 - your notes`
- **Clickable work item cards** — tapping the chip opens the work item in ADO in a new tab
- **Native Harvest composite IDs** — entries are saved with the correct `AzureDevOps_{guid}_{type}_{id}` format that Harvest's own ADO integration uses, so time entries appear in the Harvest widget inside Azure DevOps
- **Automatic GUID detection** — the Harvest connection GUID is learned automatically from any natively-created entry and persisted to `localStorage`; no manual configuration needed
- **GUID visibility & manual override** — each ADO instance in Settings shows its current GUID (green when known, orange when not); a pencil icon lets you paste the correct GUID manually

### Recent Entries
- **Default landing screen** — the app opens directly on today's entries
- **Weekly summary strip** — compact Mon–Sun strip showing each day's total; tap any day to navigate; selected day is highlighted
  - **Compact mode** (narrow): day abbreviation + hours columns with a `WeeklyProgressRing` at the end
  - **Emphasized mode** (wide): full day-tile card grid with date number, hours, and a 3 px progress bar per day
- **Weekly progress ring** — animated circular arc showing week total vs. goal; brand-orange fill, switches to amber when over goal; center label shows `Xh Ym / of 40h`; "THIS WEEK" caption with contextual helper text (`Xh to go`, `Goal met`, `+Xh over`); over-goal state moves the label beside the ring for visual emphasis
- **Group by project** — toggle to group entries under colour-coded project headers with per-group totals; preference persists across sessions
- **Daily view** — browse entries by day with prev/next navigation and a date picker
- **Daily progress bar** — visual indicator of daily progress toward a configurable goal (derived from work day start/end/break settings); shows overflow in amber; when viewing today, displays an **expected hours** tick marker on the bar and an "Expected: Xh Ym" label based on how much of the work day has elapsed
- **Edit entries** — tap the pencil icon to open a pre-filled edit form with an orange context banner showing the duration and entry ID; changes are saved via `PATCH` and reflected immediately
- **Delete entries** — tap the trash icon in the Edit Entry screen to permanently remove an entry after confirmation

### Visual Design (2.0)
- **Design token system** — `HarvestTokens` defines brand orange, warm-paper surface palette, border colours, and ADO state colours; all components reference tokens, not raw hex values
- **Duration pill** — 44 px circular pill in the leading position of every entry card; tabular-mono hours label; brand tint background; turns solid orange with a small play-arrow badge (bottom-right) when the timer is actively running
- **Project colour chips** — each project is auto-assigned one of 12 colours (persisted); shown as a short code badge on cards and group headers
- **Responsive shell** — wide screens (≥ 720 dp) use a `NavigationRail` sidebar; narrow screens use a `NavigationBar`; content is max-width constrained at 760 dp

### Background Auto-refresh
- Entries logged externally appear automatically without a manual refresh
- Refresh interval is configurable in Settings: 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, or 1 hour (default 15 min)
- Refreshes are silent — no spinner or interruption while you're actively using the app
- Skipped automatically if a submit, update, or delete is in progress to prevent conflicts

### Settings
- All credentials and ADO instances persist in browser `localStorage` and take effect immediately without recompiling
- **Project Categories** — view and customise the colour and short code assigned to each project; 12-colour palette with an edit dialog
- **Weekly Goal** — set your target hours per week (used by the progress ring and emphasized strip)
- **Work Day** — configure start time (default 08:30), end time (default 17:00), and break hours (default 0.5 h); the daily goal is derived automatically as `(end − start) − break`
- **Background Refresh** — configure how often the app silently re-fetches the current week's entries
- **Clear Cache & Refresh** — force-reloads time entries from the Harvest API
- **Migrate ADO References** — upgrades current-week entries from plain numeric external reference IDs to the correct native composite format; also repairs entries saved with the wrong GUID or a corrupted ID; scans the past 28 days for native Harvest entries to learn the correct GUID

## Setup

### 1. Prerequisites

- [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) (web support enabled)
- A [Harvest personal access token](https://id.getharvest.com/developers)
- (Optional) Azure DevOps Personal Access Token with **Read** access to Work Items

### 2. Configure credentials

Create `lib/config/app_config.dart` (gitignored — never commit this file):

```dart
import '../models/time_entry.dart';

class AppConfig {
  static const String defaultToken = 'YOUR_HARVEST_TOKEN';
  static const String defaultAccountId = 'YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID';
  static const int userId = YOUR_USER_ID;
  static const String userAgent = 'YourName (your@email.com)';
  static const String baseUrl = 'https://api.harvestapp.com/v2';

  // Default ADO instances — can be overridden at runtime in Settings
  static const List<AdoInstance> defaultAdoInstances = [
    AdoInstance(
      label: 'My Project',
      baseUrl: 'https://dev.azure.com/my-org/My-Project',
    ),
  ];
}
```

> **Note:** `/_workitems/edit/{id}` is appended automatically — only provide the project base URL.

### 3. Install dependencies & run

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run -d web-server --web-port=8080
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080` in Chrome.

### 4. Build for production

```bash
# MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 prevents Git Bash on Windows from expanding /Harvest/ to a Windows path
MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 flutter build web --release --base-href /Harvest/ --pwa-strategy=none
```

Serve the `build/web` directory from any static host.
